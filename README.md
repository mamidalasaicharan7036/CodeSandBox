A code sandbox refers to a secure and isolated environment where developers can experiment, test, and run code without affecting their local machines or the wider software ecosystem. It serves as a virtual playground for coding, allowing developers to quickly prototype, share, and collaborate on projects. Code sandboxes typically come with pre-configured setups for various programming languages, frameworks, and libraries, enabling users to dive into coding without the need for extensive setup or installation.

These environments often offer features such as version control integration, real-time collaboration, and the ability to visualize code output in a browser. Code sandboxes play a crucial role in education, enabling instructors to create interactive coding exercises and facilitating collaborative learning experiences. Additionally, they are valuable tools for open-source development, as they allow contributors to submit and review code changes in a controlled and reproducible environment.

Popular examples of code sandbox platforms include CodeSandbox, Repl.it, and JSFiddle. These platforms contribute to the efficiency and accessibility of software development by providing a hassle-free space for coding experimentation and collaboration.
